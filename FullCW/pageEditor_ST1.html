			        <h2 id="challenge">Challenges and Lesson learned</h2><br>
				        <p>During the implementation of the Splash Screen, Volunteer Page, and Content Page, several challenges were encountered. 
						For the Splash Screen, ensuring a smooth transition and accessibility during the redirection required careful use of meta tags and a loading animation. 
						The Volunteer Page faced issues with responsive card layouts and dropdown functionality, which were resolved using flexbox and JavaScript. 
						The Content Page struggled with organizing large amounts of information and ensuring accessibility, which was addressed through semantic HTML, ARIA labels, and a sticky sidebar for navigation.
						These challenges emphasized the importance of mobile-first design, accessibility, and thorough testing, providing valuable lessons in creating user-friendly and inclusive web pages </p>
